    "# Lazy Initialization\n",
    ":label:`sec_lazy_init`\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, it might seem that we got away\n",
    "with being sloppy in setting up our networks.\n",
    "Specifically, we did the following unintuitive things,\n",
    "which might not seem like they should work:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We defined the network architectures\n",
    "  without specifying the input dimensionality.\n",
    "* We added layers without specifying\n",
    "  the output dimension of the previous layer.\n",
    "* We even \"initialized\" these parameters\n",
    "  before providing enough information to determine\n",
    "  how many parameters our models should contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be surprised that our code runs at all.\n",
    "After all, there is no way the deep learning framework\n",
    "could tell what the input dimensionality of a network would be.\n",
    "The trick here is that the framework *defers initialization*,\n",
    "waiting until the first time we pass data through the model,\n",
    "to infer the sizes of each layer on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, when working with convolutional neural networks,\n",
    "this technique will become even more convenient\n",
    "since the input dimensionality\n",
    "(e.g., the resolution of an image)\n",
    "will affect the dimensionality\n",
    "of each subsequent layer.\n",
    "Hence the ability to set parameters\n",
    "without the need to know,\n",
    "at the time of writing the code,\n",
    "the value of the dimension\n",
    "can greatly simplify the task of specifying\n",
    "and subsequently modifying our models.\n",
    "Next, we go deeper into the mechanics of initialization.\n"
