    "\n",
    "We can specify devices for storage and calculation, such as the CPU or GPU.\n",
    "  By default, data is created in the main memory\n",
    "  and then uses the CPU for calculations.\n",
    "The deep learning framework requires all input data for calculation\n",
    "  to be on the same device,\n",
    "  be it CPU or the same GPU.\n",
    "You can lose significant performance by moving data without care.\n",
    "  A typical mistake is as follows: computing the loss\n",
    "  for every minibatch on the GPU and reporting it back\n",
    "  to the user on the command line (or logging it in a NumPy `ndarray`)\n",
    "  will trigger a global interpreter lock which stalls all GPUs.\n",
    "  It is much better to allocate memory\n",
    "  for logging inside the GPU and only move larger logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try a larger computation task, such as the multiplication of large matrices,\n",
    "   and see the difference in speed between the CPU and GPU.\n",

    "   and log the Frobenius norm of the output matrix one result at a time. Compare it with keeping a log on the GPU and transferring only the final result.\n",
    "1. Measure how much time it takes to perform two matrix--matrix multiplications\n",
    "   on two GPUs at the same time. Compare it with computing in in sequence\n",
