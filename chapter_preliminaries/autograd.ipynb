    "While the calculations are straightforward,\n",

    "as our models become more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately all modern deep learning frameworks\n",
    "take this work off of our plates\n",
    "by offering *automatic differentiation*\n",
    "(often shortened to *autograd*). \n",
    "As we pass data through each successive function,\n",

    "You've now gotten a taste of the power of automatic differentiation. \n",

    "both automatically and efficiently \n",
    "has been a massive productivity booster\n",
    "for deep learning practitioners,\n",
    "liberating them to focus on loftier concerns.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Why is the second derivative much more expensive to compute than the first derivative?\n",
    "1. After running the function for backpropagation, immediately run it again and see what happens. Why?\n",
    "1. In the control flow example where we calculate the derivative of `d` with respect to `a`, what would happen if we changed the variable `a` to a random vector or a matrix? At this point, the result of the calculation `f(a)` is no longer a scalar. What happens to the result? How do we analyze this?\n",
    "1. Let $f(x) = \\sin(x)$. Plot the graph of $f$ and of its derivative $f'$. Do not exploit the fact that $f'(x) = \\cos(x)$ but rather use automatic differentiation to get the result. \n",
    "1. Let $f(x) = ((\\log x^2) \\cdot \\sin x) + x^{-1}$. Write out a dependency graph tracing results from $x$ to $f(x)$. \n",
    "1. Use the chain rule to compute the derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}$ of the aforementioned function, placing each term on the dependency graph that you constructed previously. \n",
    "1. Given the graph and the intermediate derivative results, you have a number of options when computing the gradient. Evaluate the result once starting from $x$ to $f$ and once from $f$ tracing back to $x$. The path from $x$ to $f$ is commonly known as *forward differentiation*, whereas the path from $f$ to $x$ is known as backward differentiation. \n",
    "1. When might you want to use forward differentiation and when backward differentiation? Hint: consider the amount of intermediate data needed, the ability to parallelize steps, and the size of matrices and vectors involved.\n"
