    "# Layers and Blocks\n",
    ":label:`sec_model_construction`\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first introduced neural networks,\n",
    "we focused on linear models with a single output.\n",
    "Here, the entire model consists of just a single neuron.\n",
    "Note that a single neuron\n",
    "(i) takes some set of inputs;\n",
    "(ii) generates a corresponding scalar output;\n",
    "and (iii) has a set of associated parameters that can be updated\n",
    "to optimize some objective function of interest.\n",
    "Then, once we started thinking about networks with multiple outputs,\n",
    "we leveraged vectorized arithmetic\n",
    "to characterize an entire layer of neurons.\n",
    "Just like individual neurons,\n",
    "layers (i) take a set of inputs,\n",
    "(ii) generate corresponding outputs,\n",
    "and (iii) are described by a set of tunable parameters.\n",
    "When we worked through softmax regression,\n",
    "a single layer was itself the model.\n",
    "However, even when we subsequently\n",
    "introduced MLPs,\n",
    "we could still think of the model as\n",
    "retaining this same basic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, for MLPs,\n",
    "both the entire model and its constituent layers\n",
    "share this structure.\n",
    "The entire model takes in raw inputs (the features),\n",
    "generates outputs (the predictions),\n",
    "and possesses parameters\n",
    "(the combined parameters from all constituent layers).\n",
    "Likewise, each individual layer ingests inputs\n",
    "(supplied by the previous layer)\n",
    "generates outputs (the inputs to the subsequent layer),\n",
    "and possesses a set of tunable parameters that are updated\n",
    "according to the signal that flows backwards\n",
    "from the subsequent layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While you might think that neurons, layers, and models\n",
    "give us enough abstractions to go about our business,\n",
    "it turns out that we often find it convenient\n",
    "to speak about components that are\n",
    "larger than an individual layer\n",
    "but smaller than the entire model.\n",
    "For example, the ResNet-152 architecture,\n",
    "which is wildly popular in computer vision,\n",
    "possesses hundreds of layers.\n",
    "These layers consist of repeating patterns of *groups of layers*. Implementing such a network one layer at a time can grow tedious.\n",
    "This concern is not just hypothetical---such\n",
    "design patterns are common in practice.\n",
    "The ResNet architecture mentioned above\n",
    "won the 2015 ImageNet and COCO computer vision competitions\n",
    "for both recognition and detection :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016`\n",
    "and remains a go-to architecture for many vision tasks.\n",
    "Similar architectures in which layers are arranged\n",
    "in various repeating patterns\n",
    "are now ubiquitous in other domains,\n",
    "including natural language processing and speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement these complex networks,\n",
    "we introduce the concept of a neural network *block*.\n",
    "A block could describe a single layer,\n",
    "a component consisting of multiple layers,\n",
    "or the entire model itself!\n",
    "One benefit of working with the block abstraction\n",
    "is that they can be combined into larger artifacts,\n",
    "often recursively. This is illustrated in :numref:`fig_blocks`. By defining code to generate blocks\n",
    "of arbitrary complexity on demand,\n",
    "we can write surprisingly compact code\n",
    "and still implement complex neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Multiple layers are combined into blocks, forming repeating patterns of larger models.](../img/blocks.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_blocks`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From a programing standpoint, a block is represented by a *class*.\n",
    "Any subclass of it must define a forward propagation function\n",
    "that transforms its input into output\n",
    "and must store any necessary parameters.\n",
    "Note that some blocks do not require any parameters at all.\n",
    "Finally a block must possess a backpropagation function,\n",
    "for purposes of calculating gradients.\n",
    "Fortunately, due to some behind-the-scenes magic\n",
    "supplied by the auto differentiation\n",
    "(introduced in :numref:`sec_autograd`)\n",
    "when defining our own block,\n",
    "we only need to worry about parameters\n",
    "and the forward propagation function.\n",
