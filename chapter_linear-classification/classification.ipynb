    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a sufficiently common problem that it warrants its own convenience functions. Of central importance in classification is the *accuracy* of the classifier. Note that while we often care primarily about accuracy, we train classifiers to optimize a variety of other objectives for statistical and computational reasons. However, regardless of which loss function was minimized during training, it is useful to have a convenience method for assessing the accuracy of our classifier empirically. \n",

    "1. Denote by $L_\\textrm{v}$ the validation loss, and let $L_\\textrm{v}^\\textrm{q}$ be its quick and dirty estimate computed by the loss function averaging in this section. Lastly, denote by $l_\\textrm{v}^\\textrm{b}$ the loss on the last minibatch. Express $L_\\textrm{v}$ in terms of $L_\\textrm{v}^\\textrm{q}$, $l_\\textrm{v}^\\textrm{b}$, and the sample and minibatch sizes.\n",
    "1. Show that the quick and dirty estimate $L_\\textrm{v}^\\textrm{q}$ is unbiased. That is, show that $E[L_\\textrm{v}] = E[L_\\textrm{v}^\\textrm{q}]$. Why would you still want to use $L_\\textrm{v}$ instead?\n",
    "1. Given a multiclass classification loss, denoting by $l(y,y')$ the penalty of estimating $y'$ when we see $y$ and given a probabilty $p(y \\mid x)$, formulate the rule for an optimal selection of $y'$. Hint: express the expected loss, using $l$ and $p(y \\mid x)$.\n"
